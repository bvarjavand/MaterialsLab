\section{Objective}
Learn how to analyze XRD data, and get started on the lab write up.

\section{Samples}
None

\section{Procedure}
Professor Wilson went through the XRD data for annealed 1018 steel. She thoroughly explained the derivation for Bragg's Law, as well as the simplifications necessary in order to calculate interplanar spacing as well as the lattice parameter. Once this was done, I prepared the figures necessary to prove the powers of the Buckling equation from out spaghetti lab data in Matlab. The resulting figures can be seen in LabData.
