\section{Introduction}

This day our group imaged the surface fracture of our tension test samples.
\subsection{Goals}

The goal was to find data about the fracture patterns of each material.
\section{Purpose}

New insight and conclusions can be made after analyzing this additional data.
\section{Setup}

The samples for imaging were the samples left over from the previous tension testing.
\subsection{Materials}

1018 Steel as received, 1018 Steel annealed, 6061 Al as received, 6061 Al annealed.
\subsection{Tools}

An optical microscope with a large stage to hold upright samples.
\section{Procedure}

We held each sample in the microscope and focused on the cross-section where it fractured. Images were recorded and saved.
\section{Results}

All data can be seen in the LabData directory.
\section{Observations}

The strength of the material changed how it looked.
